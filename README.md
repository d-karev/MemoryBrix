A mind puzzle game for Android handheld devices that will put your short term memory to the test!

This is the first android app that I have ever made. It's a simple mind puzzle game in which you have to remove all of the tiles (or bricks) on your screen by flipping them face up 2 at a time. Each brick has its identical twin. You remove them by flipping 2 identical bricks face up. Your final score depends on how quickly you managed to remove all of the bricks, how many clicks/flips it took you and by the initial number of the bricks.

The game uses the libgdx multi-platform engine. 

So far, I have tested it on screens ranging from 480x800 to 1440x2560. 

Current version of the game is v0.6.

I may eventually finish it and get it on Google Play. 

My plans for the next version (if I ever make one) are:
- an actual scoreboard and the ability to link player names to scores;
- various difficulty levels;
- better gfx design, including better optimisation for various screen sizes;
- animations on tile flips;
- various tile sets/skins.
